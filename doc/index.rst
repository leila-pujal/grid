Welcome to grid's documentation!
================================

Grid is a free and open-source Python library for numerical integration,
interpolation and differentiation of interest for the quantum chemistry community.
Grid is intended to support molecular density-functional (DFT) theory calculations,
but it also periodic boundary conditions.
